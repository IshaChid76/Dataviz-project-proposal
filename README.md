# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the Top Streamers Data on Twicth which consists of different attributes like number of viewers, number of active viewers, followers gained and many other relevant columns regarding a particular streamer. It has 11 different columns with all the necessary information that is needed.

- Finding out the number of streamers with respect to language spoken.
- Who is the top most streamer?
- Which streamer gained more percentage of followers?

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It shows a scatter plot of [the Twitch Dataset](https://gist.github.com/IshaChid76/8e2a2a29d869d47ddf17b6dd10acac3c). It shows the total followers with respect to the total stream time for English, Portuguese, Spanish and Korean streamers. 
- Red is English streamers
- Blue is Portuguese streamers
- Green is Korean streamers
- Yellow is Spanish streamers

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Finding out the number of streamers with respect to language spoken.
 * Who is the top most streamer?
 * Which streamer gained more percentage of followers?
 * Comparison between total streaming time and total followers for each streamer.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
